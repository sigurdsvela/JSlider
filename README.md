JSlider
=======
LGPL tl;dr

Use for free, in comercial, and open source project alike. Modifications of JSlider itself must be licesed under LGPL of GPL(Open Source).

Creation of new effects for JSlider(Documentation below) does *not* count as a modification to JSlider itself, and can therfor be licensed as you wish.

A slider library that allows for simple creation of slider, and endless customization.

To get started, go to "releases" and download the latest non-prerelease version, and include it.

### Usage

Usage is fairly simple. To create the most simple slider, you must have a div, with a UL in it,
which has LI elements in it. These LI elements are your slides.

```html
<div id="your-slider-id">
	<ul id="slides">
		<li class="slide">slide1</div>
		<li class="slide">slide2</div>
		<li class="slide">slide3</div>
	</ul>
</div>
```

The "class" and "id" attribtues are *not* required, although you do need a way to select the DIV later.

After you have those elements, you need to write some javascript. Go inside
a JavaScrpt file, or create a *script* tag and write.

```js
var slider = new JSlider("div#your-slider-id"); //You can use any selector here
slider.start(); //This starts the automated slider
```

If you have done everything correctly you should be able to sit back and whatch them slides go.

You may also set some options for JSlider. This is done by passing an Object containing key=>value pairs to the JSlider constructor.

For example, to set how long the slider should stay at each slide, do:

```js
var slider = new JSlider("div#your-slider-id", {
	"delay" : 5000 //Set the delay to 5000ms
}); //You can use any selector here
slider.start(); //This starts the automated slider
```

The code above will make JSlider wait for 5 seconds before it slides to the next slide.

###Effects
You can choose the effect you would like to use to slide
between the slides. You can allso implement you own, which you can read about below.
The build in effect can be accesed by typeing jSlider.Effect.<em>effect name</em>
The built in effect are, as of the current version, as follows.
<ul>
	<li><b>CAROUSEL</b>The classic slider effect. Slides between the slides, and when it comes to the last slide, it slide naturally to the first one</li>
	<li><b>SLIDE</b> Simple slide animation, but will not carousel. Rather, it will stop on the last one. Mainly for use with a Slide thats just meant for touch scroll.</li>
	<li><b>REWIND_SLIDE</b> Same as slide, only with the rewind effect when it the slides "come to an end" </li>
	<li><b>FADE</b> Fades between the slides. Will rewind. </li>
</ul>

To implement you own effect, create an object
```js
{	
	/**
	 * This function will
	 * be ran when the slide loads,
	 * and is to initialize stuff you need.
	 * The fade effect for instance makes all slides
	 * position absolute, so to be able to fade between the slides.
	 */
	init: function(){}

	goto: function(){}
}
```

###Options
Currently avaible options are(passed in as an object as the second parameter to the JSlider constructor):
<ul>
	<li><b>(number)delay</b> : (ms) Set how long JSlider should wait before it slide.</li>
	<li><b>(number)duration</b> : (ms) Sets the animation duration</li>
	<li><b>(jSlider.Effect)effect</b> : What effect should be use on transitioning. Default is jSlider.Effect.SLIDE</li>
	<li>
		<b>button</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)next</b> : Register a button to use as next button</li>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)prev</b> : Register a button to use as prev button</li>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)start</b> : Register a button to use as start button</li>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)stop</b> : Register a button to use as stop button</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>on</b>
		<ul>
			<li><em>eventName<em> => <em>A function that will be called on said event, with a jQuery object of the current slide as the first(and only) parameter</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

###Events
<ul>
	<li><b>ready</b> Will be triggered when the slider is ready. This is after the JSlider has done it's style changes and the effect has been initilized. Do not rely on heigh/width of the slides(&lt;li>) before this event has been triggered.</li>
</ul>

###Bining event
**You may bind event one of three ways.**
```js
var slider = new JSlider("div#your-slider-id", {
	"on" : {
		"eventName" : function(currentSlide) {} //FIRST WAY
	}
});

slider.on('eventName', function(currentSlider) {}); //SECOND WAY

$("div#your-slider-id").on('jslider-eventName', function(currentSlider) {}); //THIRD WAY

```

As you may notice, if you want to use jQuery when binding the event, you must
prefix the event name with "jslider-". So instead of "start" it will be "jslider-start".


###Functions
There is also some avaible function in the JSlider object.
<ul>
	<li><b>(void)start()</b> : Start the slider </li>
	<li><b>(void)stop()</b> : Stop the slider </li>
	<li><b>(void)next()</b> : Go to the next slide </li>
	<li><b>(void)prev()</b> : Go to the previous slide </li>
	<li><b>(void)on("eventName", function(currentSlide){})</b> : Bind an event </li>
</ul>
