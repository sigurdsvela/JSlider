JSlider
=======
<b>Download the lates version from releases to get started :)</b>
<b>Pull requests are very welcome</b>
<b>If you discover an issue, create one :)</b>

A slider library that allows for simple creation of slider, and endless customization.

To get started, go to "releases" and download the latest non-prerelease version, and include it.

### Usage

Usage is fairly simple. To create the most simple slider, you must have a div, with a UL in it,
which has LI elements in it. These LI elements are your slides.

```html
<div id="slider">
	<ul id="slides">
		<li class="slide">slide1</div>
		<li class="slide">slide2</div>
		<li class="slide">slide3</div>
	</ul>
</div>
```

The "class" and "id" attribtues are *not* required.

After you have those elements, you need to write some javascript. Go inside
a JavaScrpt file, or create a *script* tag and write.

```js
var slider = new JSlider("#your-slider-id"); //You can use any selector here
slider.start(); //This starts the automated slider
```

If you have done everything correctly you should be able to sit back and whatch them slides go.

You may also set some options for JSlider. This is done by passing an Object containing key=>value pairs to the JSlider constructor.

For example, to set how long the slider should stay at each slide, do:

```js
var slider = new JSlider("#your-slider-id", {
	"delay" : 5000 //Set the delay to 5000ms
}); //You can use any selector here
slider.start(); //This starts the automated slider
```

The code above will make JSlider wait for 5 seconds before it slides to the next slide.

###Effects
You can choose the effect you would like to use to slide
between the slides. You can allso implement you own, which you can read about below.
The build in effect can be accesed by typeing jSlider.Effect.<em>effect name</em>
The built in effect are, as of the current version, as follows.
<ul>
	<li><b>SLIDE<b> Simple slide animation, will not cycle(Will not go from the last slide to the first one)<li>
	<li><b>REWIND_SLIDE</b> Same as slide, only with the rewind effect when it the slides "come to an end" </li>
	<li><b>FADE</b> Fades between the slides. Will rewind. </li>
</ul>

To implement you own effect, create an object
```js
{	
	/**
	 * This function will
	 * be ran when the slide loads,
	 * and is to initialize stuff you need.
	 * The fade effect for instance makes all slides
	 * position absolute, so to be able to fade between the slides.
	 * The SLIDE & REWIND slide for instance does not use this function.
	 */
	init : function(){}

	goto: function(){}
}
```

###Options
Currently avaible options are:
<ul>
	<li><b>(number)delay</b> : (ms) Set how long JSlider should wait before it slide.</li>
	<li><b>(number)duration</b> : (ms) Sets the animation duration</li>
	<li><b>(jSlider.Effect)effect</b> : What effect should be use on transitioning. Default is jSlider.Effect.SLIDE</li>
	<li>
		<b>button</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)next</b> : Register a button to use as next button</li>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)prev</b> : Register a button to use as prev button</li>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)start</b> : Register a button to use as start button</li>
			<li><b>(jQuery|HTMLELement|selector)stop</b> : Register a button to use as stop button</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>on</b>
		<ul>
			<li><em>eventName<em> => <em>A function that will be called on said event, with a jQuery object of the current slide as the first(and only) parameter</li>
			<li><b>(function(currentSlide)) => any)</b> : Register a function </li>
			<li><b>(function(currentSlide)) => any)</b> : Register a function that is triggered when the slider slides to the previous slide</li>
			<li><b>(function(currentSlide)) => any)stop</b> : Register a function that is </li>
			<li><b>(function(currentSlide)) => any)start</b> : Register a function that is triggered when the slider slides is started</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

###Events
<ul>
	<li><b>ready</b> Will be triggered when the slider is ready. This is after the JSlider has done it's style changes and the effect has been initilized. Do not rely on heigh/width of the slides(&lt;li>) before this event has been triggered.</li>
	<li><b>slide</b> Will be triggered when the slider slides, in either direction.</li>
	<li><b>next</b> Will be triggered when the slider slides to the next slide.</li>
	<li><b>pre</b> Will be triggered when the slider slides to the previous slide.</li>
	<li><b>stop</b> Will be triggered when the slider is stoped.</li>
	<li><b>start</b> Will be triggered when the slider is started.</li>
</ul>

###Bining event
**You may bind event one of three ways.**
```js
var slider = new JSlider("#slider", {
	"on" : {
		"eventName" : function(currentSlide) {} //FIRST WAY
	}
});

slider.on('eventName', function(currentSlider) {}); //SECOND WAY

$("#slider").on('jslider-eventName', function(currentSlider) {}); //THIRD WAY

```

As you may notice, if you want to use jQuery when binding the event, you must
prefix the event name with "jslider-". So instead of "start" it will be "jslider-start".


###Functions
There is also some avaible function in the JSlider object.
<ul>
	<li><b>(void)start()</b> : Start the slider </li>
	<li><b>(void)stop()</b> : Stop the slider </li>
	<li><b>(void)next()</b> : Go to the next slide </li>
	<li><b>(void)prev()</b> : Go to the previous slide </li>
</ul>


<b>Dependecies</b>
<ul>
	<li>jQuery</li>
</ul>
